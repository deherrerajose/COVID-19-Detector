# COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification

This project develops a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into **COVID-19, Pneumonia, or Normal** categories. Using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning techniques, the goal is to create an assistive tool for early COVID-19 detection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an image classification model using chest X-rays.
- Compare baseline CNN models with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
- Evaluate model accuracy and reliability using relevant medical imaging metrics.
- Visualize model attention areas (Grad-CAM).
- (Optional) Deploy as a web-based tool for demonstration.

## 🔧 Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Explore data distribution.
   - Resize images (e.g., 224x224), normalize, and apply data augmentation.
   - Split into `train`, `validation`, and `test` sets.

2. **Model Development**
   - Build baseline CNN from scratch.
   - Apply transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNetB0).
   - Tune hyperparameters.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC.
   - Visualize model misclassifications and areas of focus (Grad-CAM).

4. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Create a simple web interface using Streamlit or Flask.
   - Package model as `.h5` or `.onnx`.
